      <h2>Brief description of the idea.</h2>
      
      <p>Tic-tac- toy game is one of the best games that can explan how Mininmax 
        algorithm works. This game has less moves compared to other games like chess. 
        For 2 players, X and O, who immediately start marking spaces on a 3Ã—3 grid.
         The winner is the player who wins in putting three of their marks in a horizontal, 
         vertical or diagonal board. It's a set game with a predetermined draw, meaning the better game is played by both teams.</p>

      <h2>Problem formulation: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial	state: emty 3x3 grid</li>
        <li>Player(s): X&O , X will move first.</li>
        <li>Actions(s): put player mark in one of 3x3 grid layout.</li>
        <li>Result(s,a): output of the action, marked grid.</li>
        <li>Terminal-Test(s): either X or O  win orr non(tie)</li>
        <li>Utility	function(s,p): 	win	(+1),	lose	(-1),	and	draw	(0)	if non (Zero	sum	).
        </li>

      <h2>Brief description of algorithm. </h2>
      <p>In Minimax, the players are called Maximizer and Minimizer. The Maximizer is attempting to achieve the highest score possible whereas the Minimizer is trying to do the same to get the lowest score possible.

        Each condition of the board has a value correlated with it. In a given state, 
        if the maximizer has the upper hand, the score of the board will  be a positive value.
         If the minimizer has the upper hand in that board condition, it must have some negative value. 
         these value are calculated using heuristics equation which differ from game to game.</p>
